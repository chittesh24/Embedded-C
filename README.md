# Embedded-C
### Welcome to my collection of **Embedded C projects** targeting **STM32** (ARM Cortex-M) and **PIC** (8-bit/16-bit) microcontrollers. This repository contains code examples, peripheral drivers, and project templates to help developers get started with embedded systems development.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used
- **Embedded C** 
- **STM32**
- **PIC Microcontrollers**
- **Peripheral examples**: GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C, ADC, Timers, PWM, Interrupts, etc.
